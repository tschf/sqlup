# SQLcl Upgrader

**note: Currently this is tied to a particular build number (4.2.0.17.096.0933). Some enhancements in the dependent project are needed for this to be useful.**

## Overview

SQLcl is the next-gen command line interface to an Oracle database (superseeding SQL*Plus). Updates come often, so just want a tool to automate the upgrade process as much as possible. Utilises my odl utility, see that project for install insutructions.

## Assumptions

* You are on Linux
* You want to install sqlcl to /opt/sqlcl
* You have the odl utility installed and available in your path
* (Good idea to have OTN_USERNAME and OTN_PASSWORD set for minimal user input)
* Assumes you accept the OTN license agreement: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/licenses/sqldev-license-152021.html
